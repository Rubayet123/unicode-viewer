# View non-printable Unicode Characters
This is a very small HTML/JavaScript script to recognize and display Unicode characters that are otherwise invisible.

The tool's target group are software developers and others who step over strange issues when handling text/data inputs. These may be inputs from users, server responses or database contents that the own scripts do no handle as expected. If the reason is not obvious when looking at the input, it may be caused by Unicode characters that are typically invisible.

The online tool is available and can be used without installation at https://rubayet123.github.io/unicode-viewer/
